## Installation
- The code has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, python 3.6 and CUDA 10.0.

- First, in the folder of this SCALE repository, run the following commands to create a new virtual environment and install dependencies:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv $HOME/.virtualenvs/SCALE
  source $HOME/.virtualenvs/SCALE/bin/activate
  pip install -U pip setuptools
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  mkdir checkpoints
  ```

- Install the Chamfer Distance package (MIT license, taken from [this implementation](https://github.com/krrish94/chamferdist/tree/97051583f6fe72d5d4a855696dbfda0ea9b73a6a)). Note: the compilation is verified to be successful under CUDA 10.0, but may not be compatible with later CUDA versions. 

  ```bash
  cd chamferdist
  python setup.py install
  cd ..
  ```

- You are now good to go with the next steps! All the commands below are assumed to be run from the `SCALE` repository folder, within the virtual environment created above. 

## Run SCALE

- Download our [pre-trained model weights](https://owncloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/s/pMYCtcpMDjk34Zw), unzip it under the `checkpoints` folder, such that the checkpoints' path is `<SCALE repo folder>/checkpoints/SCALE_demo_00000_simuskirt/<checkpoint files>`.

- Download the [packed data for demo](https://owncloud.tuebingen.mpg.de/index.php/s/B33dqE5dcwbTbnQ), unzip it under the `data/` folder, such that the data file paths are `<SCALE repo folder>/data/packed/00000_simuskirt/<train,test,val split>/<data npz files>`.

- With the data and pre-trained model ready, the following code will generate a sequence of `.ply` files of the teaser dancing animation in `results/saved_samples/SCALE_demo_00000_simuskirt`:

  ```bash
  python main.py --config configs/config_demo.yaml
  ```

- To render images of the generated point sets, run the following command: 

  ```bash
  python render/o3d_render_pcl.py --model_name SCALE_demo_00000_simuskirt
  ```

  The images (with both the point normal coloring and patch coloring) will be saved under `results/rendered_imgs/SCALE_demo_00000_simuskirt`. 

## Train SCALE

### Training demo with our data examples

- Assume the demo training data is downloaded from the previous step under `data/packed/`. Now run:

  ```bash
  python main.py --config configs/config_train_demo.yaml
  ```

  The training will start! 

- The code will also save the loss curves in the TensorBoard logs under `tb_logs/<date>/SCALE_train_demo_00000_simuskirt`.
- Examples from the validation set at every 10 (can be set) epoch will be saved at `results/saved_samples/SCALE_train_demo_00000_simuskirt/val`.

- Note: the training data provided above are only for demonstration purposes. Due to their very limited number of frames, they will not likely yield a satisfying model. Please refer to the README files in the `data/` and `lib_data/` folders for more information on how to process your customized data.

### Training with your own data

We provide example codes in `lib_data/` to assist you in adapting your own data to the format required by SCALE. Please refer to [`lib_data/README`](./lib_data/README.md) for more details.
